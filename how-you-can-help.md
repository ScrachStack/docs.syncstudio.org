#  How You Can Help


We welcome contributions of all kinds! Whether you're improving scripts, fixing bugs, enhancing documentation, or helping shape the project’s direction, your support is invaluable.

## Updating Scripts

If you enjoy working with FiveM resources, you can contribute by updating existing scripts, fixing issues, optimizing performance, or improving readability. Keeping scripts current and polished helps the entire community—and every update strengthens the project.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Have a fix, update, or new feature to contribute?  
Submit a pull request to the appropriate repository and we'll review it. Even small improvements such as refactoring, reorganizing files, or correcting typos are helpful. Clear, descriptive PR titles and summaries make the review process smoother for everyone.

## Improving Documentation

Good documentation helps users and developers alike. If you notice missing details, outdated information, or anything that could be clearer, feel free to propose changes. You can:

- Open a pull request in the [docs repository][docs-rep]  
- Create a [GitHub issue][docs-issues] with suggestions or requests  
- Help expand explanations, tutorials, or examples  

Every improvement—big or small—makes a difference.

### Writing Standards

All documentation should follow American English (AmE) conventions for spelling, punctuation, and terminology to maintain consistency across all pages.
